Tutorial. Should be deleted shortly.

Found the information on editing. It was indeed part of the New Branch tutorial. This should be more clear in the tutorial, such as "Next, we will edit..." instead of saying "Next, work on this...", which has the implication of "Do this and then move on".

This is just to test the GUI. This whole system lacks some user-friendly properties. I'm sure it's all very clear and powerful once one gets into it, but there appears to be a shallow initial learning curve.
