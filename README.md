Tutorial. Should be deleted shortly.
There's not a whole lot of information about how to edit individual files, though I'm not even sure I'm supposed to be doing so quite yet. Perhaps Creating a Branch is how one edits files and I'm supposed to be blindly following the tutorial instead of trying to follow the instruction "work towards editing your README and closing this issue." We'll find out.
